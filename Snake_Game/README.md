## üìñ Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic **Snake Game** for the [BitDogLab](https://github.com/BitDogLab/BitDogLab) board. The game leverages the board's hardware capabilities, including an OLED display, NeoPixel LED matrix, buzzer, and joystick, to deliver a fun and interactive gaming experience.

The project is based on:
- **[BitDogLab Examples](https://github.com/BitDogLab/BitDogLab-C)**: For hardware integration and peripheral control.
- **[Snake Game in C](https://github.com/ciscocarvalho/snake-game-c)**: A previous implementation of the Snake Game in C.
